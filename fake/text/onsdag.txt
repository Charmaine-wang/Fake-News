once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey? There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! Yes, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. Brave heart, Clara. I never know why. I only know who. No idea. Just do what I do: hold tight and pretend it's a plan.
