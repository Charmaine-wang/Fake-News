Nine hundred years of time and space, and I've never been slapped by someone's mother. And I'm looking for a blonde in a Union Jack. A specific one, mind, I didn't just wake up this morning with a craving. An old friend of mine. Well, enemy. The stuff of nightmares reduced to an exhibit. I'm getting old. Ricky, if I was to tell you what I was doing to the controls of my frankly magnificent timeship, would you even begin to understand? Lots of planets have a North. Rose... before I go, I just want to tell you: you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And do you know what? So was I!
