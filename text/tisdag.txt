The world's about to end, and here I am, stuck in traffic. Grace, I came back to life before your eyes. I held back death. Look, I can't make your dream come true forever, but I can make it come true today. Don't be sad Grace. You'll do great things. I know who I am, I… AM… THE DOCTOR! I love humans. Always seeing patterns in things that aren't there. But it was a childish dream that made you a doctor. You dreamed you could hold back death. Isn't that true? Low tech? Grace, this is a type 40 TARDIS, able to take you to any planet in the universe and to any date in that planet's existence. Temporal physics.
