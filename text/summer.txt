Small though it is, the human brain can be quite effective when working at full efficiency, not unlike myself! Planets come and go. Stars perish. Matter disperses, coalesces, forms into other patterns, other worlds. Nothing can be eternal. A little gratitude wouldn't irretrievably damage my ego. A knight of the GRAND ORDER OF OBERON! Only I would be stupid enough to attack such a person! My last incarnationâ€¦oh, I was never happy with that one. It had a sort of feckless 'charm' which simply wasn't me.
